        <p>So yea... a responsive gallery styled website is in order.</p>
            <p>Enjoy some of my photos from Savannah, GA. It was hot. It was sticky. It rained every single day. And let me tell you... the food was UH-MAZING. The history was awesome. It was fun and I gave it a 6 on a scale of 1-10. Why a 6? Because if you are anywhere other than the downtown squares, it looks like Cicero, and you may get shot.</p>
