            <h2>A brief description</h2>
            <p>The 40-something college student can be an elusive creature. Typically, they converge on the college in the evening, however, you may spot an occassional 40-something during daylight hours.</p>
            <h4>Attitudes</h4>
            <p>These students may come across as distant or aloof to younger students. In all actuality, the 40-something student is actually feeling out of their element. Hipster clothing, teenage lingo, and winged eyeliner can be frightening to the 40-something college student, especially if they have spent the last 15 years working in a corporate setting.</p>
            <h4>Behaviors</h4>
            <img src="images/pres_list.jpg" alt="jenn made president's list" class="image1">
            <p class="p3">The 40-something student is typically well organized. They are usually the first to arrive to class, will be attentive, productive and engaging while in class. They also tend to be well dressed, having come from their place of employment directly to college. There are exceptions to the well dressed portion. There are a few 40-something students who will show up in yoga pants and sweaters. Do not be alarmed. They are most likely to be just as organized as their better dressed peers. </p>

            <h4 class="clearme">Diet and Exercise</h4>
            <img src="images/nachos.jpg" alt="jenn loves nachos" class="image1">
            <p class="p3">The 40-something college student's diet is very diverse. You will find that they can solely survive on coffee, with an occassional meal here and there. The ability to survive on coffee, being that is has no caloric value, stumps those in the scientific fields. The 40-something is never without a coffee cup.</p>
            <p class="p3">When they do eat, you will find that they are more likely to avoid foods commonly found in the college cafeteria. They will bring a healthy, home packed meal to consume, usually while they are studying in between class. However, if you happen to find a 40-something college student outside of the campus, you will find that they partake in beer and nachos.</p>
            <p class="p3">You will also find the 40-something college student in the college fitness center. Cardio training and weight training are essential to the 40-something. It helps reduce stress, as well as counteracts the effects of the daily caffeine. </p>
